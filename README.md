# Left-Rotation-of-an-Array
This Java program shifts array elements to the left by a specified number of times. The user inputs the array size, elements, and rotation count. Each rotation moves the first element to the end while shifting others left. The updated array is then displayed. This method efficiently rotates elements without using extra space.
